# Thermal-System-Simulation

## Description
Currently models the effects of a changing PID output related to energy cooled linearly, as well as heat exchanges from Newton's law of cooling.

## Current Functionality
- [X] Calculates PID percentage according to simulated measure temperature
- [X] PID percentage affects measured temperature by a linear relationship between energy cooled
- [X] Takes into account differences in temperature inside system and outside to simulate energy exchanges between the interior and exterior of the system
- [X] Different options to print different results of the simulation
- [X] Organised variables for simulation

## To-do
- [ ] Save results in an organised manner in a file
- [ ] Have a UI
- [ ] Simulate heat generated by cooling mechanism
- [ ] Simulate temperature changes in ambient temperature

## Changelog:
## Alpha 1.0
- Calculates PID percentage according to simulated measure temperature
- PID percentage affects measured temperature by a linear relationship between energy cooled
- Takes into account differences in temperature inside system and outside to simulate energy exchanges between the interior and exterior of the system
- Different options to print different results of the simulation
